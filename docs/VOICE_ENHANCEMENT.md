# Enhanced Voice Quality Documentation

## Overview
The voice feature has been significantly enhanced to provide much better quality speech synthesis for Hindi and Bengali languages, addressing the poor voice quality issue that was making the speech difficult to understand.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Smart Voice Selection
- **Priority-based voice selection**: Automatically selects the best available voice for each language
- **Fallback system**: Multiple fallback options if primary voices are unavailable
- **Quality ranking**: Prefers Google, Microsoft, or Natural voices over default system voices

### 2. Enhanced Text Preprocessing
- **Language-specific improvements**: Converts common English words to native script for better pronunciation
- **Technical term handling**: Proper pronunciation of technical terms like "MRL" and "AMU"
- **Natural transitions**: Better handling of mixed-language content

### 3. Optimized Voice Settings
- **Language-specific rates**: Slower speech rate (0.75) for Hindi/Bengali for better clarity
- **Pitch optimization**: Adjusted pitch for more natural sound
- **Error handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms if enhanced voices fail

### 4. User Interface Enhancements
- **Voice quality indicators**: Shows "HD" when enhanced TTS is available
- **Test voice button**: Allows users to test voice quality in their preferred language
- **Better tooltips**: Clear indication of voice features and capabilities
